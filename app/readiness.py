"""Readiness: fixed criteria, decided by rules, never by the model.

Gemma only highlights quotes. A criterion counts only when its quote really
appears in the founder's text (or comes from an uploaded slide) AND passes the
criterion's hard rule. Everything here is what the founder states; nothing is
verified. No percentages, no success prediction.
